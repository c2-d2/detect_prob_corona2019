R_code.R contains R code that loads the data, and fits the bayesian GLM model. It plots the results (Figure 1 in Niehus at al), creates Supplement Table 1, and does some other minor computations.  

R_relative_prev.R computes values and creates Figure 2 and Supplement Figure 2. 

theta_all_post1000.csv contains 1000 posterior samples of theta_high, theta_medium, theta_low and theta_global as described in Niehus et al.
